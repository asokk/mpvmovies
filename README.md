This is a sample project based off Netlix engineer Juliano Moraes' and Vasiliy Zukanov's ideas of inverting the roles of presenter and view in MV* architectures. The fragment is the presenter, and the view is a separate class.

I'm not recommending nor supporting the use of this by anyone. This is just an early test i'm doing.
